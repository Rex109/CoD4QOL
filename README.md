To download the pre-compiled binaries you can grab the latest version in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Rex109/Cod4QOL/releases)

To install it simply download and extract the files from the .zip, then drag n drop the "miles" folder in your Call of Duty 4 root folder and the "qol.ff" file inside zone/\<your game language\>, and simply run the game, no extra tools needed!

So the final folder structure should be like this:
```
.
├── ...
├── 📁 Call of Duty 4
│   ├── 📁 miles
|      └── 📜 cod4qol.asi
│   └── 📁 zone
|      └── 📁 <your game language>
|          └── 📜 qol.ff
└── ...
```

- Does not work in single player
- Does not work with cod4 stock 1.7
